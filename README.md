PROBLEM STATEMENT



Individuals with anxiety disorders, phobias (e.g., fear of flying or heights), PTSD, or mood disorders often face barriers to effective treatment. Traditional therapeutic methods may be inaccessible, stigmatized, or lack opportunities for controlled exposure. There is a need for safe, immersive environments that provide personalized therapeutic interventions, controlled exposure therapy, and mood-enhancing experiences.



PROTOTYPE GOAL

Build a VR/AR application to simulate anxiety-inducing or challenging scenarios safely.
Provide real-time feedback and adaptive difficulty based on physiological and behavioral responses.
Include guided therapeutic exercises and mood-enhancing experiences.
Record metrics for patient progress and therapist evaluation
