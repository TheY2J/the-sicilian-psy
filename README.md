PROBLEM STATEMENT



Individuals with anxiety disorders, phobias (e.g., fear of flying or heights), PTSD, or mood disorders often face barriers to effective treatment. Traditional therapeutic methods may be inaccessible, stigmatized, or lack opportunities for controlled exposure. There is a need for safe, immersive environments that provide personalized therapeutic interventions, controlled exposure therapy, and mood-enhancing experiences.



PROTOTYPE GOAL

Build a VR/AR application to simulate anxiety-inducing or challenging scenarios safely.
Provide real-time feedback and adaptive difficulty based on physiological and behavioral responses.
Include guided therapeutic exercises and mood-enhancing experiences.
Record metrics for patient progress and therapist evaluation



TEAM: THE SICILIAN

The NeuroVR platform represents a revolutionary leap in immersive therapeutic technology, designed to redefine mental health care for anxiety, phobias, PTSD, and mood disorders. Leveraging the latest advances in virtual reality hardware and sensor integration, NeuroVR transforms conventional therapy into a personalized, data-driven experience unlike anything ever seen in mental health treatment.
Engagement Score Calculation:      ES=w1⋅A+w2⋅I+w3⋅P
Where:
•	A = Attention Metrics
•	I = Interaction Metrics
•	P = Physiological Metrics
•	w₁, w₂, w₃ = weight factors you assign based on importance (e.g., Attention 40%, Interaction 30%, Physiological 30%).
1. Attention Metrics (A)

    A = time focused on task/total session Time
 
2. Interaction Metrics (I)
    I = completed tasks/total tasks * avg reaction time baseline/user reaction time
3. Physiological Metrics (P)
    P = f(HRV increase, optimal GSR range, steady breathing)
•	Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Higher HRV = calmer, engaged state.
•	Skin Conductance (GSR / EDA):Measures arousal levels (stress vs. relaxation).
•	Breathing Rate: Smooth breathing often indicates calm engagement.
